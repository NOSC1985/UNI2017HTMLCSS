			Welcome to Volleyball at Slammers
		</div>

        <div id="ArticleOneBody" class="Paragraph">
			There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. Since you don’t have to move around the court too much, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.
			Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike.
			Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.

		    How Scoring works in Pro-Volleyball
	    </div>

	    <div id="ArticleThreeBody" class="Paragraph">
			The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise.
			The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).
